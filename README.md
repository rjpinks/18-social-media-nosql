# Social Media NoSQL Site

## Description

This app was built in order to practice my backend skills with NoSQL and the mongoose ODM. It will keep track of user thoughts and reactions in a typical social media-style site. I learned about virtuals and being able to create and fill data using an ODM.

## Installation

Mongoose, express, and MongoDB are all necessary for this app. Nodemon was used, but it isn't necessairy for running the application.

## Usage

Simply use Postman or Insomnia to test the routes /api/thoughts /api/thoughts/single and api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions and also /api/users
